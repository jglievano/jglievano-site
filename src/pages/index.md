  title: Why me?
  description: >
    I am a Software Engineer for everyone who believes that great software
    engineers shouldn't just do great software, they should be great too. I
    source all my code directly from small scale sustainable iterations and
    make sure part of the utility is reinvested for team work and community.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
